# Example Data for OCT denoising

- Phantom: a 3D printed object consisting of alternating layers of transparent and translucent plastic.
- Orange: the surface of an orange.
- Chicken: chicken skin.
- Biofilm: a growth of biofilm growing on a memberane under water.

All noisy images are processed from OCT raw spectrum data using the standard SDOCT reconstruction, with top 1% outlier intensity values removed for visualization purpose and without further nonlinear scaling of intensity values (e.g. log transformation, gamma correction).
